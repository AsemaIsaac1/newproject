   <EM>Website development is my best skill</EM>, I love it and I find it easy coding. I remember how I started </b>
    this skill in 2017 when I saw Mr. Kuan Terwase's work and I was moved to learn. Even thought at this time,</b>
    I didn't KNOW whether I am cut for it, because I was not close to computer and I had a wrong notion that computer</p>
    is not for me, because I could see myself lost in my cell phone and can"t find my way out, I could send in a command </b>
    and not known the reason for the action. In all of this challanges my desier for tech was still growing, and I asked him</b>
    </p>

<p>
    <div class="box2">
    
    what must I do to learn tech at your feet, and he said something I will not forget, he said <cite> Isaac I know you too well </b>
    but concerning this if I teach you free of charge you will not value it, therefore pay me 8 thousand naira and I will teach you </b>
HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</cite>. and I obeyed and we stsrted and I learnt some html and css tags. I couln't learn JAVASCRIPT befor I</b>
 left for <a href="nysc.html" title="nysc experience">NYSC</a>. I later left the skill for some personal reasons. In 2025, I chatted<br/>
 my friend REV. DR. Eng. Justice who is doing well by the grace of God as a software engineere today. He is indeed a good man, he <br/>
 he started putting me through, leading me to gaining mastery in the world of tech till date he is still my mentor in this profession.<br/>
 This how my tech journey began.
